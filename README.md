CSE 8392 Special Topics (Advanced Application Programming)

Welcome !!!!

These were the class projects for the course 'Advance Application programming' Fall 2018. These projects were built individually using mongoDB, pycharm, jupyter notebook using python 3 with Anaconda library.

Every folder will have a PDF file which contains the problem statement along with my solution to that problem statement.

Thanks for checking out my work. Enjoy!!
